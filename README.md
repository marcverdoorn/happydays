# Happydays
Happydays is a to-do list app.
The goal of this app is to make a to-do list and get a ranking at the end of the week based on the number of finished tasks.
The next step is to connect with friends and compare your ranking with them. This way you are pushed to work harder because of the friendly competition.
With the recent covid lockdowns this app would be a helpful push to get things done, which can be hard during lockdowns.
